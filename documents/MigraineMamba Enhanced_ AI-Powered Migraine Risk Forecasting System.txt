Abstract
MigraineMamba Enhanced is a revolutionary AI-powered system that transforms the
challenge of limited healthcare datasets into a methodological breakthrough through a
novel foundation-to-personal learning architecture. Built upon comprehensive data, the
system trains a foundation Mamba model that captures population-level migraine

patterns, then progressively adapts to individual users through continual learning. By
integrating clinical temporal sequences with real-time environmental data (weather, air
quality, lunar phases), the system provides highly accurate 24h/48h migraine risk
predictions with clinical-grade explanations. This approach eliminates the cold-start
problem while enabling personalized healthcare AI without requiring wearables or
specialized hardware.

Expected Outcomes
●​ Highly Accurate Predictions: 24h/48h migraine risk forecasting with target
AUROC >0.85 through hybrid clinical-environmental modeling​
●​ Clinical-Grade Explanations: Clear identification of top 3 risk contributors with
personalized vs. population baseline comparisons​
